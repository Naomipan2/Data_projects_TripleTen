# Gold Recovery Prediction Using Machine Learning for Zyfra

	•Objective: Built a machine learning model to predict the amount of gold recovered from ore.

	•What was done: Conducted data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature validation, and trained regression models with Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
    
	•Results: Delivered a prototype model capable of estimating recovery rates, enabling optimization of production and early detection of unprofitable process parameters.
